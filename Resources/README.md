# Resources

Context materials for AI assistance - voice samples, writing examples, and reference materials.

## What Goes Here

### Voice Samples
Examples of your writing for AI to match your style:
- Technical docs you've written
- Emails that represent your tone
- Social media posts in your voice

### Writing Examples
Templates and examples for common outputs:
- Email templates
- Document formats
- Presentation structures

### Reference Materials
External content that informs your work:
- Articles you've saved
- Competitor examples
- Inspiration pieces

## How AI Uses This

When generating content, your coding agent may:
1. Read only relevant files from `Resources/` (progressive disclosure)
2. Analyze your writing patterns
3. Match tone, style, and voice
4. Generate content that sounds like you

## Example Organization

How you might organize your resources:

```
Resources/
├── voice-samples/
│   ├── technical-doc-example.md
│   └── email-examples.md
├── templates/
│   └── email-template.md
└── references/
    └── competitor-analysis.md
```

## Tips

- Include 3-5 writing samples for best voice matching
- Update samples when your style evolves
- Remove outdated examples that no longer represent you
- Keep private or sensitive materials here, this directory is gitignored by default in this repo
