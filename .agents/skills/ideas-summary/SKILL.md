# IDEAS Meeting Summary

Summarize meetings using the IDEAS framework for clear, actionable notes.

## When to Use

After any meeting to create a structured summary.

## The Framework

**IDEAS = Insights, Decisions, Engagements, Actions, Summary**

| Component | What to Capture |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Insights** | Key realizations, important information surfaced |
| **Decisions** | Choices made during the meeting |
| **Engagements** | Tasks/responsibilities assigned to people |
| **Actions** | Immediate next steps needed |
| **Summary** | Overall impact and significance |

## The Process

1. Review the meeting transcript/notes
2. Extract items for each category
3. Use bullet points for clarity
4. Focus on most important points (not every detail)

## Output Format

```
## Insights
- [Key realization 1]
- [Key realization 2]

## Decisions
- [Decision made]
- [Decision made]

## Engagements
- [Person]: [Responsibility assigned]
- [Person]: [Responsibility assigned]

## Actions
- [Immediate action needed]
- [Immediate action needed]

## Summary
[1-2 sentences on meeting's impact and significance]
```

## Quality Check

- Are all decisions captured?
- Do engagements have clear owners?
- Are actions specific and immediate?
- Would someone who missed the meeting understand what happened?

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
