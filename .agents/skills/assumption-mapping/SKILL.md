# Assumption Mapping

Generate and categorize assumptions underlying a product strategy.

## When to Use

Early in product development to surface and document what you're betting on.

## The Framework

Organize assumptions into four categories:

| Category | Focus | Example Questions |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Desirability** | Will users want this? | Problem severity, willingness to pay, switching triggers |
| **Feasibility** | Can we build it? | Technical risks, data needs, integrations, security |
| **Viability** | Will it make money? | Pricing, margins, retention, unit economics |
| **Usability** | Can users use it? | Task success, learnability, error tolerance |

## The Process

### 1. Gather Inputs

Document:
- Product description
- Core problem being solved
- Target user

### 2. Generate Assumptions

For each category, create at least 5 assumptions:

**Format:**
- Statement: "We believe that [specific, falsifiable claim]"
- Impact if wrong: [concrete consequence]

**Good example:**
- Statement: "We believe that SMB admins will pay $20/user/month if onboarding drops below 30 minutes"
- Impact if wrong: Premium pricing underperforms due to insufficient WTP

### 3. Quality Check

Each assumption should be:
- Specific (include numbers, segments, timeframes)
- Testable (you could run an experiment)
- One idea per assumption (no compound claims)

## Output

Four lists of 5+ assumptions each:
- Desirability assumptions
- Feasibility assumptions
- Viability assumptions
- Usability assumptions

Each with statement and impact if wrong.

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
