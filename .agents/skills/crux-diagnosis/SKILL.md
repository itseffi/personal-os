# Strategic Crux Diagnosis

Identify the pivotal obstacle between current state and desired future.

## When to Use

When developing strategy or facing complex strategic decisions.

## The Concept

**Crux:** The smallest set of obstacles that, if solved, makes everything else tractable or unnecessary.

## Required Inputs

Gather before analysis:
- Current state (baseline metrics, capabilities)
- Desired future (time-bound outcome, targets)
- Constraints (budget, headcount, tech, compliance)
- Available assets (data, channels, IP, partnerships)
- Key risks and non-negotiables

## The Process

### 1. Map Current to Future

Create a causal graph:
- Start: Current state
- End: Desired future
- List all blockers in between

### 2. Score Each Blocker

Evaluate on:
- **Causal centrality:** How much else depends on this?
- **Bottleneck severity:** How much does it slow everything?
- **Solvability:** Can we actually fix it?
- **Leverage potential:** If solved, how much unlocks?
- **Time to impact:** How fast could we see results?
- **Evidence strength:** How sure are we this is the problem?

### 3. Identify the Crux

Find the blocker(s) where:
- Solving it unlocks the most downstream progress
- It's actually solvable given constraints
- Time to impact is acceptable

### 4. Generate Strategic Options

Create 4-7 options aimed at the crux:
- Include at least one non-obvious approach
- Include at least one constraint-relaxation option
- Evaluate against decision criteria

## Output

- Executive summary (situation, crux, approach)
- Evidence pack (facts, assumptions, uncertainties)
- Crux definition with scoring
- Options comparison table
- Chosen strategy with rationale
- Strategic moves (3-5) with owners and timelines

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
