# Root Cause Analysis

Uncover root causes and explore consequences through structured questioning.

## When to Use

When you need to deeply understand a problem, decision, or situation before acting.

## The Process

### 1. Recursive "Why" Questioning

Start with the initial question and ask "Why?" repeatedly:
- Ask "Why?" at least 5 times
- Go deeper until you reach fundamental causes
- If multiple reasons emerge, explore each branch

**Example:**
- Why did users churn? → Onboarding was confusing
- Why was it confusing? → Too many steps
- Why too many steps? → We added features without simplifying
- Why didn't we simplify? → No ownership of onboarding experience
- Why no ownership? → Org structure doesn't align to user journey

### 2. Consequence Exploration

After finding root causes, explore forward:
- **1st order:** Immediate consequences
- **2nd order:** What results from those?
- **3rd-5th order:** Downstream effects

Consider both positive and negative outcomes.

### 3. First Principles Check

- What fundamental truths underlie this?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What alternative perspectives exist?
- Where are the gaps in logic?

## Output Format

- Root causes (the "Why?" chain)
- Consequences (1st through 5th order)
- First principles (fundamental truths, assumptions)
- Conclusion (key insights)

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
