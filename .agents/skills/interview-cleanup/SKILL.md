# Interview Transcript Cleanup

Clean up raw interview transcripts while preserving meaning and speaker voice.

## When to Use

After conducting user interviews when you have raw transcripts that need cleanup before analysis.

## The Process

1. **Read the full transcript** to understand context and flow

2. **Remove noise without losing meaning:**
   - Filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
   - False starts (incomplete/abandoned sentences)
   - Redundancies (repeated words that don't add meaning)

3. **Preserve what matters:**
   - Original meaning and intent
   - Speaker's unique voice and style
   - Speaker labels (Interviewer:, Interviewee:)
   - Unclear/inaudible markers [inaudible]

4. **Light editing only:**
   - Fix punctuation and capitalization
   - Don't over-formalize casual language
   - Don't cut unnecessarily

## Quality Check

- Does the cleaned transcript read naturally?
- Is the original meaning preserved?
- Can you still hear the speaker's voice?
- Are all speakers clearly labeled?

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
