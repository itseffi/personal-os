# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior.

## Overview

Turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue. Understand before implementing.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out current project state first (files, docs, recent changes)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Only one question per message - break complex topics into multiple questions
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why
- Present options conversationally

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to a planning document
- Commit the design before starting implementation

**Implementation:**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use `writing-plans.md` skill to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task directly matches the workflow described above.

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
