# Influence Strategies (Cialdini)

Generate influence strategies using Cialdini's seven principles.

## When to Use

When you need to influence a stakeholder or group toward a specific outcome.

## The Seven Principles

| Principle | Core Idea | Application |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Reciprocity** | People return favors | Give first, then ask |
| **Liking** | People say yes to those they like | Build rapport, find common ground |
| **Unity** | Shared identity creates connection | Emphasize "we" and shared goals |
| **Authority** | People defer to experts | Demonstrate expertise, cite credible sources |
| **Social Proof** | People follow others | Show what peers/competitors do |
| **Consistency** | People honor commitments | Get small yeses before big asks |
| **Scarcity** | Limited = valuable | Highlight unique opportunity, deadlines |

## The Process

### 1. Define Your Context
- Who are you trying to influence?
- What outcome do you want?
- What's their current position?

### 2. Generate Ideas for Each Principle

For each of the seven, create at least one strategy:
- **Strategy:** What specifically to do
- **Rationale:** Why it works for this situation

### 3. Select Best Approaches

Prioritize strategies that:
- Fit the context naturally
- Are ethical and professional
- Create value for both parties
- Build long-term relationship

## Principles

- Focus on positive influence, not manipulation
- Create genuine value for both parties
- Maintain professional ethics
- Build relationships, not just transactions

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
