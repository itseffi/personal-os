# Stakeholder Power-Interest Map

Map stakeholders by power and interest to plan engagement strategy.

## When to Use

When starting an initiative that involves multiple stakeholders.

## The Framework

### Power-Interest Grid

| | Low Interest | High Interest |
|---|---|---|
| **High Power** | Keep Satisfied | Manage Closely |
| **Low Power** | Monitor | Keep Informed |

### Influence Pyramid

Beyond formal power, map informal influence:
- **Top tier:** Decision makers, budget holders
- **Middle tier:** Gatekeepers, team leads
- **Base tier:** Super-connectors, exec assistants

## The Process

### 1. List Stakeholders

Gather:
- Names and roles
- Organizational position
- Known relationships
- Allies and blockers

### 2. Map to Grid

Place each stakeholder in the 2x2 based on:
- **Power:** Formal authority, budget control, veto ability
- **Interest:** How much they care about this initiative

### 3. Build Influence Pyramid

Identify informal power:
- Who controls access?
- Who influences opinion?
- Who connects people?

### 4. Profile High-Power Stakeholders

For each, document:
- Goals and success metrics
- Likely concerns (political, operational, reputational)
- Preferred communication style
- Political risks for you

### 5. Create Engagement Plan

For each high-power stakeholder:
- Cadence and channel
- Format and owner
- Key message (tied to their priorities)
- Quick win to offer
- Fallback if they resist

## Output

- Power-Interest matrix with names
- Influence pyramid with rationale
- High-power profiles table
- Engagement plan table
- Top 3 political pitfalls to avoid

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
