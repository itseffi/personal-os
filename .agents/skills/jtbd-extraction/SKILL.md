# JTBD Extraction from Interviews

Analyze interview transcripts using the Jobs to Be Done framework to understand why people make changes.

## When to Use

When analyzing customer interviews to understand decision-making and switching behavior.

## The Framework

JTBD breaks decisions into four forces:

| Force | What it captures | How to phrase |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| **Pushes** | Pain with current situation | "When..." statements |
| **Pulls** | Desired outcomes | "So I can..." or "So I don't..." |
| **Habits** | Comfort with status quo | "When..." (positive aspects) |
| **Anxieties** | Fears about change | Questions or concerns |

## The Process

1. **Read the transcript** looking for moments of change or decision

2. **Extract statements** for each force:
   - Pushes: "When I'm not listened to..."
   - Pulls: "So I can work with someone who trusts me..."
   - Habits: "When I really like my current community..."
   - Anxieties: "Can this really be fixed?"

3. **Capture context:**
   - Current situation
   - Job/role
   - Key challenges

4. **Synthesize insights:**
   - What's driving potential change?
   - What's holding them back?
   - What outcome do they really want?

## Output Format

Provide:
- Context summary
- Pushes (list)
- Pulls (list)
- Habits (list)
- Anxieties (list)
- Key insights about decision-making

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
