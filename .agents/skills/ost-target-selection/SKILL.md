# OST Target Selection

Choose exactly one opportunity to pursue next.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Harvest candidates from OST
- Include leaves and relevant parents with strong evidence.
- Merge duplicates and reframe solution language into need language.

### Step 2: Score candidates
- Score 1-5 for OS, MF, CF, CuF.
- Use default weights unless custom weights are provided.
- Compute weighted priority score (WPS).

### Step 3: Build shortlist
- Select top 3-5 by WPS.
- Apply tie-breakers: distinctness, evidence quality, time-to-learning, risk diversification.

### Step 4: Recommend one target
- Pick one small, distinct, moment-scoped opportunity.
- Exclude engineering effort prioritization.

### Step 5: Audit alignment
- Confirm no-effort-policy and moment distinctness.
- List evidence gaps and follow-up needs.

## Output

- Candidate inventory
- Scoring matrix with WPS
- Top 3-5 shortlist
- Single recommendation with rationale
- Audit notes
