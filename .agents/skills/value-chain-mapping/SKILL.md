# Value Chain Mapping

Map value creation from user needs to foundational inputs.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Capture end-user needs
- List primary user needs the product serves.

### Step 2: Build value chain hierarchy
- Trace from needs -> activities -> enablers -> foundational inputs.

### Step 3: Identify core value generators
- Mark nodes that generate defensible advantage.
- Explain why each is hard to replicate.

### Step 4: Assess vulnerabilities
- Highlight disruption points and fragility in chain links.

## Output

- End-user needs
- Value chain breakdown
- Core value generators
- Potential vulnerabilities

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task directly matches the workflow described above.

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
