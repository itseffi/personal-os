# MECE Analysis

Structure thinking using Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive categories.

## When to Use

When you need to break down a problem, categorize options, or ensure complete coverage.

## The Principle

**MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

- **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlap between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** All possibilities covered

## The Process

### 1. Analyze Mutual Exclusivity

For each pair of items:
- Is there any overlap?
- Could something belong to both?
- If overlap exists, redefine boundaries

### 2. Analyze Collective Exhaustiveness

For the whole set:
- Are there gaps?
- What scenarios aren't covered?
- What's missing?

### 3. Create Logical Tree

Structure as hierarchy:
- Top level: Broadest categories
- Sub-levels: More specific breakdowns
- Each level should be MECE

## Example

**Bad (not MECE):**
- Marketing channels: Social, Digital, Facebook, Email
- (Facebook overlaps with Social and Digital)

**Good (MECE):**
- Marketing channels: Paid, Owned, Earned
  - Paid: Social ads, Search ads, Display
  - Owned: Email, Website, App
  - Earned: PR, Reviews, Word of mouth

## Output

- MECE categories with clear boundaries
- Logical tree showing hierarchy
- Notes on any gaps or overlaps found

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
