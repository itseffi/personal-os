# Competitor Analysis (Porter)

Analyze competitors using Porter's four-component model.

## When to Use

When you need to understand a competitor's strategy, capabilities, and likely moves.

## The Framework

Porter's four components:

| Component | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Objectives** | What are they trying to achieve? (growth, profit, share, positioning) |
| **Current Strategy** | How are they competing? (segments, pricing, channels, roadmap) |
| **Assumptions** | What do they believe about the market, themselves, and rivals? |
| **Capabilities** | What can they actually do? (resources, competencies, gaps) |

## The Process

### 1. Objectives (Future Goals)
- Economic goals (growth, profitability, market share)
- Strategic goals (positioning, tech leadership, ecosystem)
- Timeframes and indicators
- Priority ranking

### 2. Current Strategy
- Target segments and value proposition
- Pricing and monetization
- Go-to-market (channels, partnerships)
- Product roadmap themes
- Geographic posture

### 3. Assumptions
- About the industry (demand, regulation, tech trajectory)
- About themselves (core competencies, cost position)
- About you and other rivals
- Implicit beliefs inferred from behavior

### 4. Capabilities
- Tangible: cost structure, capacity, balance sheet
- Intangible: brand, IP, data, culture, talent
- Activities across value chain
- Notable gaps and constraints

### 5. Synthesize: Likely Moves

Based on the four components:
- What will they respond to quickly vs. ignore?
- Probable near-term moves (ranked by likelihood)
- Expected response speed by move type

### 6. Implications for Us
- Risks to monitor
- Opportunities to exploit
- Recommended counter-moves
- "If they do X, we do Y" mapping

## Output

- Executive snapshot
- Four components analysis
- Likely moves and response profile
- Implications and recommendations
- Evidence sources
- Unknowns and validation plan

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
