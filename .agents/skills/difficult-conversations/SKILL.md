# Difficult Conversation Prep

Prepare for challenging work conversations using a structured framework.

## When to Use

Before any conversation you're dreading or that has conflict potential.

## The Framework: Prepare-Listen-Empathize-Clarify-Solve

### 1. Preparation Notes

Document:
- Your intent (what you want to achieve)
- Non-negotiables (what you won't compromise on)
- Specific facts/examples (concrete, not accusations)
- Language traps to avoid
- Desired outcome
- Success criteria
- Medium choice (in-person/video/async)

### 2. Opening Lines (3-5 options)

Create openers that are:
- Neutral, non-accusatory
- Reference concrete impact
- Invite their perspective

**Examples:**
- "I wanted to talk about [situation] because I've noticed [impact]..."
- "I'd like to understand your perspective on [issue]..."
- "Can we discuss [topic]? I want to make sure we're aligned..."

### 3. Questions to Ask (5-7)

Use open questions (what/how/when):
- Avoid "why" framing (feels accusatory)
- Include one perspective-taking question
- Include one constraints question

### 4. Anticipate Reactions

Prepare responses for:
- **Denial:** [De-escalating response]
- **Deflection:** [Redirect response]
- **Emotional reaction:** [Calming response]
- **Counter-accusation:** [Non-defensive response]

### 5. Clarify and Solve

- State shared goals
- Present options with trade-offs
- Agree on commitments
- Assign owner and timeline
- Schedule follow-up

## Self-Management Checklist

- [ ] Deep breaths before starting
- [ ] Slow speaking pace
- [ ] Use pauses deliberately
- [ ] Notice body tension
- [ ] Stay curious, not defensive

## Output

- 1-page prep doc
- Opening lines (3-5)
- Questions list
- Reactions/responses table
- Close and next steps
- Escalation flags (if HR/compliance needed)

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
