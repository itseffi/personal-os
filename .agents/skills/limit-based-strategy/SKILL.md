# Limit-Based Strategy

Use limit-based thinking to move from problem statement to execution plan.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define growth variable and limit state
- Identify the primary growth variable.
- Describe the mature limit state clearly.

### Step 2: Identify core properties
- List features and dynamics that must exist at the limit.

### Step 3: Estimate convergence
- Provide milestones at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% with dates/triggers.

### Step 4: Identify acceleration levers
- List levers to steepen convergence.
- Prioritize top 1-2 highest impact levers.

### Step 5: List critical assumptions
- Capture assumptions and how each will be validated.

### Step 6: Produce execution design
- One-sentence vision.
- Major roadmap milestones.
- 3-phase plan: Foundation, Acceleration, Optimization.
- Resource guidance.

## Output

- Growth variable
- Limit state
- Core properties
- Convergence estimate
- Acceleration strategies
- Critical assumptions + validation
- Vision and phased execution

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task directly matches the workflow described above.

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
