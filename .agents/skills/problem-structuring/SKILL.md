# Problem Structuring

Break down complex problems into actionable recommendations.

## When to Use

When facing a complex, ambiguous problem that needs structured analysis.

## The Process

### 1. Simplify the Problem

- Identify core components
- List key stakeholders
- Summarize in 2-3 sentences

### 2. Deductive Analysis (Top-Down)

Start broad, work to specifics:
- What's the general situation?
- Create logical tree of options
- Map cause-and-effect relationships
- Explore branches and outcomes

### 3. Inductive Analysis (Bottom-Up)

Start with specifics, find patterns:
- Examine data points and examples
- Look for patterns and trends
- What do specifics suggest about the whole?

### 4. Synthesize

Combine both approaches:
- Where do they agree?
- Where do they conflict?
- What insights emerge?

### 5. Develop Recommendation

Based on analysis:
- Clear, actionable recommendation
- Rationale tied to analysis
- Trade-offs acknowledged

## Output Format

- **Simplified problem:** Concise summary
- **Deductive analysis:** Logical tree with options
- **Inductive analysis:** Patterns from data
- **Synthesis:** Combined insights
- **Recommendation:** Clear action with rationale

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
