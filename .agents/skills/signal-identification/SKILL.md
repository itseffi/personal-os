# Signal Identification

Design efficient early signals to validate product assumptions.

## When to Use

When you have a prioritized assumption and need the fastest way to validate it.

## The Quality Bar

A good signal is:
- **Early:** Obtainable at idea/prototype stage
- **Cheap:** Minimal cash/time
- **Attributable:** Directly reduces uncertainty
- **Decisive:** Has clear success/failure threshold
- **Suitable:** Appropriate for your context

## Method Selection by Context

| Context | Good Methods | Avoid |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Enterprise B2B** | Design partner LOIs, security questionnaires, ROI calculators, reference checks | Smoke tests, consumer ad funnels |
| **SMB SaaS** | Discovery calls, lightweight trials, email tests, usage analytics | - |
| **Consumer** | Ad-driven intent, waitlist conversion, community polls, preorders | - |
| **Regulated** | Standards mapping, SME review, regulatory preflight | Collecting sensitive data |
| **Feasibility** | Engineering spikes, benchmarks, vendor evals | User-facing experiments |

## The Process

### 1. Classify the Assumption

What lens? Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, or Usability?

### 2. Brainstorm Signals (5+)

For each, note:
- What would constitute positive evidence?
- How to obtain quickly?
- Why suitable for this context?

### 3. Select Best Signal

Document:
- Signal description
- Method (step-by-step)
- Participants/sample needed
- Timebox and cost
- Success threshold (quantified)
- Data captured
- Risks and mitigations
- What to do next if positive

## Output

- Brainstorm list (5+ signals)
- Selected signal with full details
- Summary explaining choice

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when the request is unrelated, low-stakes, or better handled by a simpler direct response.
