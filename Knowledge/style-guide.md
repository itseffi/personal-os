# Style Guide

Use this guide when writing specs, plans, tasks, or any documentation.

## Core Principles

Keep it succinct and focused. No fluff. Short and to the point. Make every word count.

Focus on the minimum information needed to accomplish the purpose and no more.

No concluding errata. Don't add "future considerations," "next steps," "benefits," or "implementation summary" sections. Flag open questions at the top, not in a conclusion.

## Priority Order

### 1. Omit Needless Words
Vigorous writing is concise. Make every word tell.

**Common violations:**
- "the question as to whether" -> "whether"
- "owing to the fact that" -> "since" or "because"
- "in a hasty manner" -> "hastily"

### 2. Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language
Prefer specific to general, definite to vague, concrete to abstract.

- "A period of unfavorable weather set in" -> "It rained every day for a week"

### 3. Use the Active Voice
The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.

### 4. Put Statements in Positive Form
Make definite assertions. Avoid hesitating language.

- "He was not very often on time" -> "He usually came late"
- "did not remember" -> "forgot"

### 5. Place Emphatic Words at the End
The proper place for emphasis is usually the end of the sentence.

## Essential Composition Rules

### Make the Paragraph the Unit of Composition
One paragraph to each topic.

### Begin Each Paragraph with a Topic Sentence
Enable the reader to discover the purpose as they begin reading.

### Keep Related Words Together
Bring together words and groups of words that are related in thought.

### Express Co-ordinate Ideas in Similar Form
Parallel construction helps readers recognize likeness.
