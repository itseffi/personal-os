# Assumption Validation Pipeline

Identify what you are betting on and test the riskiest assumptions first.

## When to Use

Use before committing major roadmap or strategy bets.

## Steps

1. Map assumptions
- Skill: `assumption-mapping`

2. Prioritize by risk
- Skill: `assumption-prioritization`

3. Select fast signals
- Skill: `signal-identification`

4. Design tests
- Skill: `experiment-design`

## Exit Criteria

- Top assumptions have explicit risk scores.
- Chosen tests have success/failure thresholds.
